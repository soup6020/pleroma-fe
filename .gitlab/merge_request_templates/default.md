<!-- List what your merge request changes and how -->
<!-- 
Try to not to break existing behavior, if your changes do break existing behavior 
make it configurable to toggle between old behavior and new. Which one should be
default is up to discussion.
-->
<!-- If your merge request resolves some issue link it like so: "Closes #99999" -->
<!-- 
If merge request adds some new feature that depends on backend: 

1. Make sure it gracefully degrades if backend hasn't been updated to support the feature,
   we try to make PleromaFE compatible with older versions of BE so that people can still
   update frontend safely without updating backend since it's costly and much riskier. 
2. Link related BE merge request here
